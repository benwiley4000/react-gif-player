## Contribute
Contributions are welcome. If the change you'd like to implement is a new feature, please open an issue first.

### Build
To install build dependencies, run `npm install`.

Run webpack with `npm run build`. Built files can be found in the `dist/` directory. You can also use `npm run dev`; it's configured to do exactly the same thing, except it will continue watching for any changes you make, and recompile.

### Test
After building, you can test your changes by opening up `example.html` in a web browser.
