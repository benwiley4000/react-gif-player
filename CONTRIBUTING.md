### Build
To install build dependencies, run `npm install`.

Run webpack with `npm run build`. Built files can be found in the `dist/` directory.

### Test

The project is configured with webpack-dev-server. You can run `npm run dev` to start the dev server. This will build the module, watch the source for changes, and serve `example.html` from http://localhost:8080 by default (ie, http://localhost:8080/example.html), or a different port if 8080 is unavailable. Source changes will be reflected automatically in the browser.
